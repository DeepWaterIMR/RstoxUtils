This package contains utility functions for stock assessment and
data flow within the Institute of Marine Research (IMR). The package has two
purposes: 1) To function as a showcase and developmental platform for
functions that may be included in the future releases of the Stox Project.
2) To provide a collection of functions needed in the internal workflow
of the Deep-sea species group at IMR.
